This is a template for new projects using React, react-router and redux.
Building with Webpack and parsing with Babel.

Download the files then run `npm install` followed by `npm start`, and open up `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` in a browser!

##Known issues##
Need to use webpack-dev-server to get the React-Router functionality of BrowserHistory to work
